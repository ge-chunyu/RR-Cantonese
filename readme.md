# Reproducible research: A case study of Cantonese intonation

This is a repository which stores a presentation on reproducible research with a case study of Cantonese intonation. The materials were presented in Speech and Phonetics Lab, Institute of Linguistics, CASS, on 7th May, 2019.

The file `rr.md` is the presentation file. The presentation was written in *markdown*, and the presentation was generated using `pandoc`. The folder `figs` contains two files, `workflow.mmd` and `fda.mmd`, which generates flow charts of the workflows of phonetic research and FDA, respectively. The two flow charts were written in `mermaid`.
